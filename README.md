# Monte Carlo Ray Tracer

Monte Carlo ray tracer with Path Tracing and Photon Mapping written in C++. 

This program was made for the course [Advanced Global Illumination and Rendering (TNCG15)](https://liu.se/studieinfo/kurs/tncg15) at Link√∂pings Universitet.

A report describing this work in more detail is available [here](report.pdf).

## Compiling

Currently only Visual Studio 2019 project files are included. Compiling on other platforms should be straightforward however, just compile the *.cpp* files in [source](source) with [external/glm](external/glm) and [external/nlohmann](external/nlohmann) directories added to the include path. Requires a compiler with C++17 support.

## Renders

The following images are renders of [scenes/hexagon_room.json](scenes/hexagon_room.json) using various settings and *camera 0*.
